# Bamazon

Have you ever wanted to pretend to buy stuff from an online retailer, but without actually getting any of the stuff?  Well if you have, then Bamazon is for you.  Now you can experience all of the tedium of databases, the stunning graphic displays of CLI tables, and none of the hassles of actually receiving cool packages delivered right to your doorstep.  

For the thrilling customer experience, open your Terminal, navigate to the directory where you've cloned the Bamazon repository, then run the command $ node bamazonCustomer.js and hold onto your chair.  
If text-based fake shopping is too much for you to handle and you'd rather pretend to be a middle-manager, then run $ node bamazonManager.js from your Terminal.
Or, for you thrill-seekers who want to live like an assistant-to-the-upper-middle-manager, try running $ node bamazonSupervisor.js from your Terminal.
